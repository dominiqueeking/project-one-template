				<div class="moremeanings"><h2>Minor Aracana</h2> <br>
					The 56 Minor Arcana cards reflect the trials and tribulations that we experience on a daily basis. Even though the Minor Arcana cards are called ‘minor', it doesn't mean that these Tarot cards won't have a significant impact in your life. These Tarot cards relate to what's happening in your daily life, and can offer insight into how your present situation is affecting you and what steps you need to take to manifest your goals.
